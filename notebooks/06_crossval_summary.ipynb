    "To validate the generalization of my ConvNeXt-Tiny model, I ran 5-fold cross-validation using the official ESC-50 folds. For each run, I trained on 4 folds and validated on the remaining one, repeating this process across all 5 folds. Due to training time, each fold was trained for **5 epochs**.\n",

    "- ConvNeXt-Tiny consistently achieved **79%+ accuracy** on all folds, with very little variance ‚Äî a strong sign of generalization.\n",
    "- Fold 4 yielded the best result (87.25%), possibly due to more learnable samples or slightly easier class distribution in the validation set.\n",
    "- Even with limited training (5 epochs), the model surpassed the performance of both the custom CNN and ResNet18 in every fold.\n",
    "- This cross-validation provides strong evidence that the model's success isn't tied to a particular subset of the data.\n",
